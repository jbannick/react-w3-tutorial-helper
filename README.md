# Lab Notes and Source Code for the w3schools React Tutorial
This repo contains the lab notes and source code created as I took the w3schools React tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/react/

The lab notes clear up some ambiguities and minor gaps.  

The Hello World and Next sections describe how I set up their Create React environment.  

The lab notes dealing with each tutorial section describe how I executed that section and my results. 

My source code is often modified from the original tutorial examples, to clarify, or sometimes present additional, related, code. 

This repo is not a substitute for the tutorial.  
IMO their tutorial is excellent. Their structure and text are clear and concise.  
All the examples, except Select in the Forms page, work. That example works within their TryIt environment, but not within the Create React environment. See my lab notes for more on this specific case.
